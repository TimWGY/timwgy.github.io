							<h2>A data enthusiast's urban dream<br />
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am Tim Guangyu Wu, a recent graduate of MS in Data Science program at Columbia University. Currently, I am a research assistant at the Mapping Historical New York project. My research and work is at the intersection of data science and urban studies, with a focus on spatial history and social impact. I am interested in how urban morphology and mobility choices influence the development of different communities and how we can enhance equity and sustainability through data-driven design.

											Evaluation of Mutual Funds’ Stock-selecting Ability in China</a>
										
										<p>This paper examines the stock-selecting ability of mutual funds by conducting an empirical study on 
												China’s IPO market from 2010 through 2015. With an underlying assumption that positive expectations about 
												stocks drive funds’ investment decisions, this study implements a two-stage testing methodology. 
												Firstly, this study estimates funds’ selection ability by controlling typically-used determinants of fund 
												investment decisions. Then I evalu- ate the post-IPO performance of the selected stocks 
												by using the Buy-and-Hold Abnormal Returns model and Fama-French Three-factor model. 
												The findings demonstrate that mu- tual funds can differentiate stocks, especially in the downside.</p>

											A Concert-planning Tool for Independent Musicians by Machine Learning Models</a>
									
									<p>Our project aims at helping independent musicians to plan their concerts based on the economies 
										of agglomeration in music industry. Initially, we planned to design an advisory tool for both 
										concert pricing and location selection. Nonetheless, after implementing SGD linear regression 
										and support vector regression models, we realized that concert price does not vary significantly 
										according to different music types, concert time, concert location and ticket venues. 
										Therefore, to offer more useful suggestions, we focused on the location choice problem by turning 
										it to a classification task. The overall performance of our classification model is pretty good. 
										After tuning hyper parameters, we discovered random forest gives the best performances, 
										improving the classification result by 316%. This result reveals that we could help independent 
										musicians better locate their concerts to where similar musicians would go, 
										namely a place with higher network effects.</p>

										Insights into the Impact of R&D Investment on Capital Structure Decisions of Chinese High-Tech Firms</a>	
									
									<p>By introducing the country-level tax reduction for R&D firms in China as an 
										exogenous event to establish causality, we examine how R&D investments associate 
										with changes in capital structure. We find that, in contrast to the popular belief 
										that firms with higher R&D investments have lower debt ratio via higher agency costs, 
										firms who are approved for the tax credit increase R&D investments and increase debt ratio 
										following the event. However, among those firms that have been approved, the changes in R&D and 
										debt ratio appear to be a one-time e↵ect and thus the policy turns out to fail to create continue 
										impetus for firms to keep investing in innovations.</p>

										Optimization of Airport Waiting Time</a>	
							
									<p>In this project, we provided an model assessing the overall operating efficiency of airport customs, 
										based on the data in all terminals of New York JFK airport, using M/M/c queueing framework. 
										We simplified the objective function by speculating the graph of the function and tried regression 
										upon the observation. We obtained a transformed approximation model which has a high explanation 
										power of over 93%. After that, we input the simplified expression into GAMS and applied SCIP nonlinear 
										mixed integer solver, and obtained our optimized strategy to a list of opening booths according to 
										the hour of the day.</p>

									<h3>Living in a Black Hole</h3>
									<p>This is a story about a geek girl who who suffers from social norms. As gender related problems 
										is similar to a black hole for most Chinese, I directed, filmed and edited this movie 
										to share my own struggles and to raise people's awareness.
